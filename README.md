# GUI_Browse
In this lesson's homework assignment you are going to implement your own GUI-based Python program with PyQt5.
We won't provide a template for the GUI this time, so you will have to design it yourself from scratch and put it together in QT Designer. 
However, we will provide a list of required GUI elements that will allow the user to provide the needed input for the program. 
The program will use arcpy but it is intended to be a standalone program, so it's not supposed to be run as a script tool inside ArcGIS,
and that's why it needs its own GUI. The program will realize a simple workflow for extracting features from a shapefile on disk based on selection by attribute 
and selection by location. If you took Geog485 along time ago, you will notice that this is similar to what you did there in lesson 3 and you will also already 
be familiar with the data we will be using. If you took Geog485 more recently and did the assignment with NHL hockey players, it's still a similar approach 
using multiple selection operations but with different data.
Even if it's unfamiliar, don't worry, we are intentionally keeping the feature extraction task simple and providing some sample code that you can use 
for this so that you can focus on the GUI development aspects.
Data used is attached.
